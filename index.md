## Causes of Autumn Colors:

The brilliant colors of autumn are primarily the result of changes in pigments within the leaves of deciduous trees. During the growing season, chlorophyll, the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis, dominates and masks other pigments.
As autumn approaches, decreasing daylight hours and cooler temperatures signal to trees that it's time to prepare for winter. The tree gradually stops producing chlorophyll.
As the chlorophyll breaks down and disappears, other pigments that were present in the leaves all along become more visible. These pigments include carotenoids (yellow and orange) and anthocyanins (red and purple).

## Colors of Autumn Leaves:

**Yellow and Orange:** Carotenoids are the pigments responsible for the bright yellow and orange colors in leaves. They are always present in the leaf but are hidden by the dominant green chlorophyll during the growing season. As chlorophyll fades, carotenoids become more prominent.

**Red and Purple:** Anthocyanins are responsible for the red and purple hues in some leaves. Unlike carotenoids, anthocyanins are not always present in leaves. They are produced in response to certain environmental conditions, including sunlight, temperature, and moisture. These conditions can vary, explaining why not all trees or even all leaves on a tree turn red.

**Brown and Rust:** Some trees and leaves may turn brown or rust-colored due to the presence of tannins and waste products as the leaves die off.

## Notable Trees with Vibrant Autumn Colors:

- **Maples:** Maple trees, including sugar maples and red maples, are renowned for their brilliant red and orange leaves in the fall.
* **Oak Trees:** Different oak species display various shades of red, brown, and russet during autumn.
+ **Sweetgum Trees:** Sweetgum trees feature a mix of red, orange, and purple leaves.
- **Dogwood Trees:** Dogwoods showcase vibrant red leaves in the fall.
* **Aspen and Birch Trees:** These trees often display bright yellow leaves during the autumn months.
